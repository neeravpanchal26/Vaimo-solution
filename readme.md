Reactjs framework was used for this solution, given the time-frame this is the best possible solution that could've been coded by me.

`Why did I choose ReactJS?`

I'm very comfortable with reactJS library, it takes less development time. It is flexible and easy to maintain blazing fast during development. Biggest plus point it's open-source.

`If I was to do this project again, what would I change?`

I would try and use AngularJS or VueJs to solve this problem. It would give me an opportunity to learn more frameworks like Angular or Vue.
